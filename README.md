# YOSCO
 Yamaha-OSC Bridge

Yosco is a protocol bridge that receives OSC messages and translates them into a format that can be understood by Yamahaâ€™s CL, QL and TF series consoles. Yosco runs on the same machine as the OSC sender, which can be any arbitrary application, such as QLab. It is not a controller in itself, it is a translator.

Note that the UDP/TCP toggle is for testing purposes only.
Use UDP to send test packets on the local-host.
Use TCP to send packets to a Yamaha console.
